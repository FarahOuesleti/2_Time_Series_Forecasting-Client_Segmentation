# Time_Series_Forecasting

## Global Overview
- Time series Analysis : 
This is a restaurant and coffeeshops forecasting project. It predicts their sales according to the time, their revenues, the types of products sold and interprets the results in a report.

- Client segmentation :
This project includes a Client Segmentation part using K-means, the clients being a set of restaurants & coffeeshops of an automation startup.

## Problem and purpose of the project
### 1. Time Series Analysis part ( Main part of the project )
Many restaurants and coffeeshops have their sales database registered at a third part, every order passed by a client, order content, time, price, etc. is registered in the database. We thought it useful to analyze that data relative to time, to extract useful information helping business holders make informed decisions.
Hence, We analyzed and intended to predict : 
  - Sales revenues overall the period of available data
  - Overall Products' sales
  - Number and types of delivered and take away prducts ( Serves for Resources planning : HR, space allocation etc. )


### 2. Clients' segmentation part
For this part of the project, We consider the clients being the set of restaurants and coffeeshops that decided to collaborate with the startup to automate their orders' registration process.
The purpose of this analysis, is to determine what sort of coffeeshop/restaurant decides to adopt this methood and be a client of the startup, their medium price range, their location, their expected customers( students, high income adults, medium income adults etc. ), their working times, their busy hours etc.
